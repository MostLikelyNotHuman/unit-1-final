                        <p> Welcome to Music for Beginners! This application is designed for anyone 
                            who is a complete beginner to music, and aims to teach you the very basics of 
                            reading notes and rhythm. Located on the top bar or the home page are links 
                            to a variety of exercises to strengthen your reading skills. Currently, 
                            you can find exercises to test your ability to recognize notes, intervals, and rhythms.</p>
                        <p> The goal is that you take the skills you learn here and go on to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read your favorite music!</li>
                            <li>Write your own music!</li>
                            <li>Transcribe your favorite songs!</li>
                            <li>And many more activities!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This help page covers the things you'll need to know to interact with the different 
                            activities, but is by no means a complete overview of the basics of reading music. 
                            Feel free to use whatever other resources you would like to help improve your skills!</p>

                    <h3>Notes</h3>
                        <p>Notes are arranged on something called a <strong>staff</strong>, which is this set of horizontal
                        lines.</p>
                            <img src={staffImage} width={400}></img>
                        <p>Each line and space on the staff represents a different pitch.
                        A common way to remember where each note goes is to use the mnemonic
                        'Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge' for the lines E G B D F, and
                        the word FACE for the spaces F A C and E.</p>
                            <img src={notesImage} width={400}></img>
                        <p>The exercises here use two additional notes that sit just below the staff, C and D.</p>
                            <img src={additionalNotes} width={150}></img>
                        <p>Maybe you've noticed - the notes start over at A after G! The system only 
                        uses the first seven letters of the alphabet to identify notes. However, there are more 
                        than seven notes - there are actually twelve! Each of these notes can be modified in pitch 
                        by placing something called an <strong>accidental</strong> before it. These are 
                        called <strong>Sharps (♯)</strong> and <strong>Flats (♭)</strong>, and represent a slightly 
                        higher or lower pitch, respectively.</p>

                    <h3>Intervals</h3>
                        <p>The word 'interval' refers to the distance in pitch between two notes.
                        The smallest distance between two notes in western music is called a <strong>half-step</strong> or a <strong>semitone</strong>. 
                        This is the distance between G and G♯ or B and B♭, for instance.</p>
                        <p>{`An oddity to keep in mind with this system is that, while most of the notes on the staff above are separated 
                            by two half steps (A -> A♯ -> B), this does not hold for the spaces between B and C and 
                            between E and F. These two sets of notes are only a half step apart. While an E can have a sharp 
                            accidental, an E♯ and an F are the same pitch!`}
                        </p>
                        <p>Every interval has its own unique name. The following are the ones you'll need to know 
                        for the exercises here.</p>
